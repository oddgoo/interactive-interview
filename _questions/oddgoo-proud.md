Seeing the concept of a collaborative community being succesful and coming to life:

- Playing hundreds of levels already made by the community, with mechanics and ideas that I would have never imagined.

- Speed runners beating each others' times.

- Collaborating with other musicians to make specific tracks.

- Players using the "Remix" feature to put their own twist on a campaign level.

This is a game where the the premise of the story itself is about dreamers coming together and imagining a universe, and that is the concept that's also driving our interaction with the community.

We want to help everyone see their imagination come alive, so seeing this actually happen has already made us feel like the game is a success.
