question: "What is the most interesting game development project you have ever worked on?"
---

To talk about something that is not Amberial Dreams, that would be **Sound Scouts**, a medical device that tests for hearing problems.
It has the shape of a game to make it engaging and fun for children, but is actually a medical device!

Working on that has brought the unique challenge of coming up with interesting game mechanics while following and respecting a clinical protocol. But the principles of iteration and testing to have a great game have applied just the same!
