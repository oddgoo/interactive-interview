question: "How did you come up with the game's unique mechanics and features?"

Amberial is our life-long project to take everything that we like about platformers, and make an evolving universe that's all about creativity and the pure joy of rolling and bouncing around.

Where there is a lack of jumping, your avatar makes up on speed and bouncing around. This places a unique focus on the level design; we want players to develop an intimate relation with its physics, the geometry and all the mechanisms, creating a strong sense of place.
