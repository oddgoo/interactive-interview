question: "What are some of your favorite 2D platformers and what do you like about them?"
---

When I was born, my siblings already had a commodore Amiga 500 and an Atari XE, so I remember games as far as my memory of being alive begins. I loved platformers since the beginning; there was something pure about the ease of movement and exploration of a rich but understandable environment. With the Amiga, I actually played Giana Sisters before Super Mario, but also Leander, Flashback, Technoventure (hard to even google now!), Zool, and Shadow of the Beast. Inspired by them, I would spend days drawing and imagining my own games and levels.

A bit afterwards, my family got a chinese knock-off NES console. Very popular in Mexico at the time. We would have these cartidges with "99999" games in them. But Between that and my cousin having an actual NES, my world was opened to Nintendo. The sense of exploration and variety in Super Mario Bros 3 still makes it one of my favorite games to date. I would spend hours with my friends imagining  that we were in the game and jumping around, no matter where we were.
That of course led to and carried on through to all Super Mario games. Their success has always felt very well earned, creatively speaking.

Growing up, I continued to open my taste to all genres, and at different points got obsessed with everything from ICO, Tony Hawk Pro Skater, Age of Empires, Minecraft, and much more.

There may be a theme of gameplay freedom and exploration across these favorites, but more recently, linear narrative games have also made a big impression and stayed with me: What remains of Edith Finch, The Beginners Guide, Before your Eyes. etc.

But in any case, you asked about platformers, so I will leave it at that :D
