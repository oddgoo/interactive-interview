question: "What's the most challenging aspect of developing a 2D platformer?"
---

Level designs and Game mechanics have to be developed hand in hand; it's hard to test the mechanics without having a lot of variety in the levels, but if something changes in the mechanics, all the levels that use it need to be reviewed or redesigned.

Also, from a market perspective, the game needs to be very unique or special to be noticed, as it is a very saturated genre.
