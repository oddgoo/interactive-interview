question: "How did you approach the design and aesthetic of the game?"
---

I am very driven by the concept of **Sense of Place** which Wikipedia defines as *"A multidimensional, complex construct used to characterize the relationship between people and spatial settings. [...] those characteristics that make a place special or unique, as well as to those that foster a sense of authentic human attachment and belonging"*

The realms in the game were initially conceptualised by a genuine process of taking cues from actual dreams, the real worlds, and closing my eyes to see what comes up in the screen of the imagination. These concepts are then refined by an iterative process of collaborating with the team, the community, letting music drive more visuals, and letting visuals drive more music.

I like to call this a deliberate synesthetic journey!

I'm so passionate about this topic that I've given talks about it at local meetups. I'm sure in another life I would have been a full-time architect or interior designer.
