The level editor is part of the reason why we called it an evolving universe. We want to see players make wild levels, share them, and be surprised in how such a simple control mechanism can give birth to a endless trove of ideas.

But, we also called it evolving because we are working and playing very closely with the community to guide its design. And really, everything about it has been an evolutionary process. The development team are actually fans of the original flash game. We are now in our thirties, but can see that the game has more potential than ever.
