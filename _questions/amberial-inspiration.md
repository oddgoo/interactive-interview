question: "What was the inspiration for the game's concept and story?"
---

<p>The original Amberial (2007) has a curious story.</p>
<p>I wanted to make a web game about breaking the 4th wall, literally.</p>
<p>And as a web game contained in a window, I envisioned a simple marble character literally
    pushing against the walls of the browser,
    trying to use momentum, springs and strings to get enough force to break out.</p>

<p>So I started making that, but before I got to coding the actual wall breaking mechanics, I
    realised the game was fun enough as it was, and my focus shifter to building environments
    and soundscapes to create a proper feeling of adventure and traversal.
</p>
<p>The concept itself is heavily inspired by games like Marble Madness, Within a Deep Forest and
    Super Monkey Ball, where you cannot jump and all the focus on the environment and level
    design. In games like these, you are not only seeing where you can land and what obstacles
    to avoid, but you get to savour the angle of each bounce, the momentum against every gap.
</p>
<p>After the first Amberial, each new version has been an evolution of the concept heavily
    guided by player feedback. This all culminates in Amberial Dreams, which has everything each
    previous game had.
</p>
<p>As for the story, there has always been some environmental narrative in the background, but
    Amberial Dreams takes a huge leap and presents a story that evolves from and complements the
    game concepts and environments, giving life to abstract ideas.
