question: "Can you tell us a bit about yourself and your background in game development?"

I am a scanner, addicted to learning new things and exploring the world.
Games are great for people like us, since they bring together all forms of art and novel experiences. They keep things interesting and wondorous, specially in the indie space!

My gamedev career started with a bit of a bang in 2007.
It was the peak of the flash era; I was still in high school in Mexico and was starting to get into game development. Amberial was my first game, and it proved to be quite popular in places like Kongregate, Newgrounds and Armor Games. That intial success led me to make a few sequels, still on the flash platform.

Over time, I made other small games and sequels for Amberial, but later moved to Australia, flash died as a platform, and I got into AR / VR, contract work, and other hybrid applied gaming projects. In 2018, I started rescuing the concept of the game and showed the prototype in a few local shows, where it was clear that it still had potential, leading to today!

These days I still play everything from Atari 2600 to the latest VR releases. But I like to prioritise, when possible, non digital experiences like museums, nature and theater shows, as cross-media inspiration creates a more fertile ground for the imagination.
