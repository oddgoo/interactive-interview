question: "How did you approach the game's sound and music design?"

The game takes place on a cosmic soup of golden factories, colorul parades, neon temples, and much more. So everywhere you go, we are striving for it to feel memorable, and to have , as mentioned above, a richness and a strong sense of place.

This of course is obvious with the visuals, but there is a very fun challenge of also mapping the music to these concepts. Each world is a different genre and style, so you feel like you are moving through musical dimensions with unique personalities.

And what is really cool is that the music track then DRIVES somes more dynamic elements in the game, eg: many pieces move to its rhythm; when the player collides, it makes a note that is in key with the track, etc.

Thankfully, this approach has worked well, as compliments on the music and sound have been the number one feedback when showing the game.
