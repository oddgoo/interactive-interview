question: "What is the game development tool or software you couldn't live without?"
---

I'll just mention my whole stack, since I'm pretty comfortable with it at the moment:

- Obvious to say, but **Version Control** (git), back in the flash days I started without it lost entire days of work a few times.
- For visual stuff, I use the Serif suite (**Affinity Photo** and Designer). I like that it doesn't need a subscription, and is pretty light.
- Any decent project management tool. I currently love **Airtable** due its speed, flexbility, and genereous free
- For music, I've tried over 10 "DAWs", but keep coming back to **Bitwig**. For me it offers the best  balance between interesting creative ideas, great UI, pricing, and stability.
- For coding, the **Jetbrains suite** (Rider, Pycharm, Webstorm). It's awesome to develop stuff in a wide range of technologies using a unified and super powerful IDE
- For general knowledge Management, or simple note-taking, **Obsidian** is open source and works on simple markdown files, allowing me to sync and work on multiple devices with ease.
