question: "How did you balance the difficulty and accessibility of the game for different types of players?"
---

This is one of the biggest challenges, but we use a combination of listening to players and looking at data. Sometimes we have very cleary messages from the community that something is off, other times we need to see the analytics to check which level has a big drop-off, which can indicate it needing to be easier or more interesting.

With this goal, we also allow intrepid players to try some of the hardest levels when they first launch the game, or anyone can try the community creations and make their own experiences with the editor.
