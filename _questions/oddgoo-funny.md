question: "Can you share any funny or interesting anecdotes from the development of this game?"

I've been making this game for years, not to mention the original flash games, and I cannot place even in the top 10 of leaderboards anymore!

I also have not being able to beat some of the hardest levels in the Spire of Trials (made by community players that turned into team members).
